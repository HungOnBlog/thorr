# Thorr

Thorr is a simple, yet powerful, tool for doing integration test and load testing of HTTP APIs. It is written in Go and is designed to be easy to use and extend.

## Key concepts

- **[Test Suit](#test-suit)** A test suit is a collection of tests. It is a JSON file that contains the test cases.
- **[Test](#test-test-case)** A test is a single test case. It contains the request and the assertions.

## Test suit

Test suit is a collection of test cases. A test suit will be a JSON file that contains the test cases with the following format:

```json
{
  "name": "Test suit name",
  "description": "Test suit description",
  "default": {
    "base_url": "http://localhost:8080",
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
  },
  "tests": [],
}
```

## Test (Test case)

Test is a specific case (request) you want to test. It will be defined in the test suit file with the following format:

```json
{
  "name": "Test name",
  "description": "Test description",
  "request": {
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/",
    "headers": {
      "apikey": "apikey"
    },
    "queries": {
      "key": "value"
    },
    "body": {
      "key": "value",
      "key2": 1
    }
  },
  "assertions": [
    {
      "on": "status_code",
      "check": "exact",
      "expected": 200
    },
    {
      "on": "body",
      "check": "type",
      "expected": {
        "key": "string",
        "key2": "string"
      }
    },
    {
      "on": "headers",
      "check": "exist",
      "expected": {
        "apikey": true,
        "Content-type": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Road map

- [ ] Implement the integration test
- [ ] Implement the load test
- [ ] Support GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE methods
- [ ] Add more assertions type (e.g. body contains, body not contains, body match regex, ...)
- [ ] Add more test types (e.g. load test, ...)
- [ ] Add more reporters (e.g. HTML, ...)
- [ ] Add more test file formats (e.g. YAML, ...)
- [ ] Add dynamic path (e.g. /user/:id) with customer resource loader (e.g. database, file, aws s3, ...)
- [ ] Build Github Action for Thorr
- [ ] Web UI for Thorr
- [ ] Helm chart for Thorr
